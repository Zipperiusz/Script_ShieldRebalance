# Building
First clone SDK repository https://github.com/georgeto/gothic3sdk
Then clone this repository into `gothic3sdk\source\Scripts`. You should be able to build your project using Visual Studio with platform toolset v120.

# Installation
Copy the file `Script_ShieldRebalance.dll` into your Gothic 3 `scripts` folder directory.
